NextRent is a web application designed to track home expenses and split bills across roommates. We support both splitting by income proportion, or by a custom, manually-inputted arrangement that you and your roommates agree upon.

We also keep track of payments over time, as this allows roommates to hold each other accountable when providing for household expenses. Users may set monthly household goals, such as keeping utilities under a certain amount or contributing toward a shared savings target, and track your progress together.
